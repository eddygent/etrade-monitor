       " 'content': 'Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) concluded the trading at $180.09 on Thursday, June 01 with a rise of 1.60% from its closing price on previous day.\\n\\nTaking a look at stock we notice that its last check on previous day was $177.25 and 5Y monthly beta was reading 1.30 with its price kept floating in the range of $176.931 and $180.12 on the day. Company’s P/E ratio for the trailing 12 months is 30.60. Considering stock’s 52-week price range provides that AAPL hit a high price of $179.35 and saw its price falling to a low level of $124.17 during that period. Over a period of past 1-month, stock came adding 6.85% in its value.\\n\\nWith its current market valuation of $2793.19 billion, Apple Inc. is set to declare its quarterly results on Jul 26, 2023 – Jul 31, 2023. AAPL Stock’s Forward Dividend of 0.96 and its yield of 0.53% are making investors’ thoughts stronger that it could climb further before the company announces its earnings for the current quarter. Analysts are in estimates of $1.19 per share for company’s earnings in the current quarter and are expecting its annual EPS growth moving up to $5.97 for 2023 with estimates of that growing to $6.56 in next year. These estimates are suggesting current year growth of -2.30% for EPS and 9.90% growth next year.\\n\\nAnalysts watching the company’s growth closely have provided estimates for its revenue growth with an average revenue estimate of $81.51 billion. They suggested that in the process company could generate revenue of as low as $75.58 billion which could climb up to $94.1 billion to hit a high. The average estimate is representing a decrease of -1.70% in sales growth from that of posted by the company in the same quarter of last year. In keeping analyst consensus estimate with, company is forecasted to be making an annual revenue of $384.61 billion in 2023, which will be -2.50% less from revenue generated by the company last year.\\n\\nIn last 7 days, analysts came adjusting their opinions about stock’s EPS with no upward and no downward revisions, an indication which could give clearer idea about the company’s short term price movement. In contrast, when we review AAPL stock’s current outlook then short term indicators are assigning it an average of 100% Buy, while medium term indicators are categorizing the stock at an average of 100% Buy. Long term indicators are suggesting an average of 100% Buy for it.\\n\\nAccording to ratings assigned by 41 analysts at the scale of 1 to 5 with 1.00 representing a strong buy and 5.00 suggesting a strong sell; 11 of them are recommending Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a Hold, while 23 are in view that stock is a Buy. Recommendation by 0 analysts for the stock is an Underweight while number of those analysts who rated the stock as an Overweight is 6, whereas 1 of them are considering the stock as a Sell. When taken as whole, stock gets a rating of Overweight and that encourages the investors to exploit the opportunity and build their stake up in the company.\\n\\nDigging deeper we become aware of the PEG ratio of the AAPL stock which is currently positioned at 3.82. It further provides that stock’s current price level is 4.11% away from its 20-day simple moving average and is 7.53% off its SMA50. Its relative strength index (RSI) for 14-periods is oscillating at 71.37 while volatility remained at 1.49% over the past week which changes to 1.37% when measuring it over the past month. Beta is valued at 1.29, while measure of average true range or ATR is currently at 2.66. In predicting price targets of as low as $127.00 and as high as $209.00, analysts are in agreement on assigning the stock over the next 12 months average price target of $181.03. Stock’s current price level is 29.48% above from estimated low price target while it is -16.05% below the estimated high; and even if the AAPL’s share succeeded to reach the median price of $183.86, then the outlook of -2.09% could come to the excitement of the investors.\\n\\nIn comparing Apple Inc. (AAPL)’s stock with other industry players reveals that stock’s current price change of 1.60% and that of 21.00% over the past 12 months is in competing position with that of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) which saw its stock price raised by 1.28% in the last trading and went through an increase of 22.33% in past 12-month trading. Industry’s another major player Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has rise 0.81% up in previous session, but over the past year has faced a rise of 9.06%, while Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was also up 0.69% however its price remained floating in the green at 8.75% over the same period. Apple Inc. has a P/E ratio of 30.60 against that of Microsoft Corporation’s 36.05 while Alphabet Inc. is showing 26.80 for the same. On the other hand, the S&P 500 Index was up 0.99% in the last trading session while the Dow Jones Industrial closed the session higher at 0.47%.\\n\\nHaving a second look at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) provides that stock’s average daily trading volume for 3 months was 58.84 million, while it jumped to 58.51 million when we calculate an average volume for past 10 days. Number of outstanding shares of the stock stood at 15.79 billion.\\n\\nThe percentage of outstanding shares held by the insiders is 0.07% while it is 60.10% for the institutional holders. The figures also indicate that as of May 14, 2023, number of stock’s short shares was 109.88 million which implies a short ratio of 2. This shows down a 0.70% of Short Interest in company’s outstanding shares on the day. In May the standing of shares short improved as it was 114.99 million in the previous month. Addition of 38.61% by stock’s current price to its year-to-date value in last trading session is likely to be increasing investors’ interest in the stock as it is hinting an extended uptrend.',\n",
